# reqbody
This is really early, this is a super minimal wrapper for http.get which returns a complete body.

Don't expect this to get a lot more sophisticated than it currently is.

##usage

Basically this module is a wrapper around http.get from node core.

```javascript

var reqbody = require('reqbody');

var request = reqbody({
	path : '/path',
}, function(res) {
	var body = res.body;
})

```

Thats about it for now.
